HOWTO Setup an OVMS server
==========================


0. DO I NEED THIS?

You don't need to run your own OVMS server.
You can just use the public Open Vehicles OVMS server.
The choice is yours.


1. PREREQUISITES

You'll need a Linux. OSX, BSD, or other flavour of Unix, server with a public IP address and
a shell account able to setup a daemon listening on a port. You'll need a modern version of
perl running on that server, and a bunch of perl modules (from cpan).

You'll need a MYSQL server running on the same machine, or another machine, and credentials
to be able to create a database and accounts.

This could conscievably run on a windows server, but you are on your own ;-)
[ let us know instructions if you manage to get it running ]


2. MODULE INSTALLATION

Install the following perl modules from CPAN:

  Config::IniFiles
  Digest::MD5
  Digest::HMAC
  Crypt::RC4::XS
  MIME::Base64

  DBI
  DBD::mysql
  EV
  AnyEvent
  AnyEvent::HTTP
  AnyEvent::HTTPD
  HTTP::Parser::XS
  Data::UUID
  Email::MIME
  Email::Sender::Simple
  Net::SSLeay
  JSON::XS

Install modules using cpanminus:
  cpanm Config::IniFiles Digest::MD5 Digest::HMAC Crypt::RC4::XS MIME::Base64 \
    DBI DBD::mysql EV AnyEvent AnyEvent::HTTP AnyEvent::HTTPD HTTP::Parser::XS \
    Data::UUID Email::MIME Email::Sender::Simple Net::SSLeay JSON::XS


3. MYSQL SETUP

Create a mysql database "openvehicles" and use the ovms_server.sql script from github (server
directory) to create the necessary ovms_* tables. Create a mysql username and password with
access to the database.

Insert a record into the ovms_cars table, to give you access to your own car:

      vehicleid: DEMO
         owner: 1
       carpass: DEMO
      userpass: DEMO
   cryptscheme: 0
      v_ptoken: 
  v_lastupdate: 0000-00-00 00:00:00

Obviously, change the vehicleid, carpass and userpass as necessary. The only required fields are
vehicleid and carpass.


4. OVMS_SERVER ACCESS TO MYSQL

Create a file ovms_server.conf which defines the access to the mysql database:

  [db]
  path=DBI:mysql:database=openvehicles;host=127.0.0.1
  user=<mysqlusername>
  pass=<mysqlpassword>

If the host is remote, change the host= parameter to be the remote IP address. Use 127.0.0.1 for local.

Test the connection with:

  $ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u <mysqlusername> -p 
  Enter password: <mysqlpassword>
  Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

If you get "ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied", fix it before proceeding. The most likely cause
is a mistake in your mysql user grant rights.


5. ENABLE SSL (optional)

If you want to support SSL connections to your server (port 6869 for the REST API, port 6870 for
OVMS MP), you need to supply a certificate. You can create a self-signed certificate or get a
certificate signed by some root CA for your server.

In both cases you need to merge the private key PEM and the chain PEM into the file "ovms_server.pem"
located in the same directory as the "ovms_server.pl". Also take care to secure the file, as it now
contains your private key.

To create a self-signed certificate, do:

  $ openssl req -sha256 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout privkey.pem -x509 -days 365 -out fullchain.pem
  $ cat privkey.pem fullchain.pem >ovms_server.pem
  $ chmod 0600 ovms_server.pem

Or, if you want to reuse e.g. your Let's Encrypt server certificate, do this as root:

  # cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourhost/privkey.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourhost/fullchain.pem >ovms_server.pem
  # chmod 0600 ovms_server.pem
  # chown youruid. ovms_server.pem

â€¦ and add a cron job or certbot hook to check for renewals and redo these steps as necessary.


6. RUN THE SERVER

Get the ovms_server.pl code from github and run it with:

  $ ./ovms_server.pl
